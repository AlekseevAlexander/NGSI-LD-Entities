# Harmonised Entities

##Overview

Data interoperability has been identified as a technical barrier that prohibits the realisation of the full potential value of IoT data.
To help address that problem, in this document data models are defined of entities or things that are commonly used in IoT applications.
The definitions of the data entities have been developed through contributions from participating mobile operators and aligned with existing industry work and namespaces where possible,
for example, oneM2M in Smart Home, OASC for Smart Cities and schema.org for generic entities.

##Scope

This resource specifies harmonised data models that have been developed by members of the [GSMA IoT Big Data Ecosystem Project](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/).
The harmonised data models are expected to evolve over time, potentially new entities will be added and entity definitions changed.
Contributions are welcome from the wider developer community to develop and update the data entities.

##Vertical Segments

The harmonised data entities below originate from and are used in the following industry verticals (or IoT Domains):

* Agriculture
* Automotive
* Environment
* Industry
* Smart City
* Smart Home

| Entity Name | Specification | Context Definition | Example Entity |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Vehicle** | [*Vehicle* entity specification.](definitions/Vehicle.md) | [*Vehicle* context example.](examples/Vehicle-context.jsonld) | [*Vehicle* entity example.](examples/Vehicle.jsonld) |
| **Vehicle Fault** | [*Vehicle Fault* entity specification.](definitions/Vehicle-Fault.md) | [*Vehicle Fault* context example.](examples/Vehicle-Fault-context.jsonld) | [*Vehicle Fault* entity example.](examples/Vehicle-Fault.jsonld) |
| **Vehicle Type** | [*Vehicle Type* entity specification.](definitions/Vehicle-Type.md) | [*Vehicle Type* context example.](examples/Vehicle-Type-context.jsonld) | [*Vehicle Type* entity example.](examples/Vehicle-Type.jsonld) |
