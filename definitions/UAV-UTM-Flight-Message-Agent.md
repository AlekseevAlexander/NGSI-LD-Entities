# UAV UTM Flight Message Agent
This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic UAV UTM Flight Message Agent that is designed to subscribe to the Global UTM Association protocol message according to a specific UAV entity. This entity supports the functionality of a service provider to confirm the validity of UTM Flight Message generated by UTM Flight Message Entity. The service provider can include their own Flight Control Policy to the original UTM Flight Message and forward this to a UAVTMS entity.
